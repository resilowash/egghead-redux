//This master selector file is a stub of a stateselector style pattern where you would want to pass one part of state to the actual selector
//Since this application doesn't really have multiple parts of state to connect we don't really need to combine selectors like this. 

//export const getTodoItems = (state) => todoSelector.getTodoItems(state.)
